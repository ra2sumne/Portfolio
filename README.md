## Description
My name is Rawlric Sumner and I'm currently a student in the Columbia FinTech program. I'm participating in this program as a means of providing myself the necessary technical skills to supplement my Bachelor of Arts in Economics. 

As of right now, I, unfortunately, don’t have a career in the financial services field. Throughout my undergraduate career, I worked in higher education management. My journey in the higher education industry saw me start as an executive assistant in essence and end as a program director/coordinator for technology education and secondary school support. While this has allowed me to remain gainfully employed post-graduation, it has prevented me from seizing necessary opportunities to gain the required experience for entry-level employment in the financial services industry. Through this Financial Technology boot camp, I hope to rectify this lack of necessary skill and expertise while also building a personal brand that allows me to be a competitive hire. Through financial knowledge and technical skills I will gain through this program, I hope to present myself as a valuable asset to any economic sector team. Due to my lack of direct experience, I currently do not have a definite notion of where I’d like to end up. However, through the upcoming months, I hope to contact fields that interest me enough to pursue a career in the sector.
